Coding challenge
The following tries to process and analyse book_review_data. The files are cleaned as per the following process:
1. Missing information was updated
2. Null values are treated
3. Numerical columns were standardised
4. Renaming the column for proper understanding
5. Dropping unnecessary columns and rows.
   The file is analysed for information such as:
   1. Top-rated authors
   2. Books with the  highest rating
   3. Top publishing years
   etc.
